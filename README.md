# Mental Health App

WIP[Work In Progress]

This is our first group collaboration project after competing as a team in the Girl Develop It 2021 Hackathon. Our team worked so well together we continued working together. This group of female-only coders have banded together to learn, grow, and work with each other through this Mentorship Program (created, managed, and maintained by Ms. Amber Merritt.) We will be making a "Mental Health" app that will seek to aid all communities once completed. Stay tuned :)

PS -- I didn't know what to do for the file structure so I went extra and tried to make a more organized basic `HTML JavaScript` and `CSS` file structure for now. Amber has said that we are going to have **2 repositories**, one for Front-End the other for Back-End dev. 

So exciting!
